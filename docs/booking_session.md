# Feature: Learner finds a posted session by Subject + Time Range and books it

## User Story
As a **Learner (Tutee)**, I want to **search tutors’ posted sessions by subject and time range and book one** so that **I can attend an online tutoring session at a convenient time**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Happy path:** After I sign in and search by subject and time range, I see matching sessions; choosing one and confirming shows “Booking confirmed” and a meeting link.
2. **No double-booking:** If I try to book the same session twice, I see “You are already booked for that session.”
3. **Capacity enforced:** If a session is full, I see “This session is full.”
4. **Time conflict:** If my chosen session overlaps another upcoming session of mine, I see “This session conflicts with another session.”
5. **Auditability:** A successful booking creates a `SessionAttendee` linking me (learner) to the chosen session, and the session has a meeting link.

## MVC Outline

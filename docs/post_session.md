# Feature: Tutor posts sessions

## User Story (Connextra)
As a **Tutor**
So that **I can have learners sign up for one-on-one sessions**
I want to **post sessions** ## Acceptance Criteria (SMART)
1. **Happy path:** I post my availability to the Tutor Catalog along with times, capacity, and subject. I am redirected to my upcoming sessions list and see "Session successfully created".
2. **Unknown information:** If I do not fully fill out all the information for the session, creation is rejected with validation error messages.
3. **Overlapping slots:** If I try to create a session that overlaps with one of my existing sessions, creation is rejected with a "Session overlaps with existing session" message.
4. **Cancel slots:** If I view my upcoming sessions, I can "Cancel" a session. (Note: Sessions are cancelled, not fully deleted from the database).

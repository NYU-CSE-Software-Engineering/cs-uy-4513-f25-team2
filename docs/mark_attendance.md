# Feature: Tutor marks a learner's attendance for a tutoring session

## User Story
As a **Tutor**, I want to **mark a learner's attendance for a tutoring session** so that **the learner and I can both keep track of their session attendance**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Happy path**: If I mark a learner as present, I see a "Learner marked as present" confirmation message
2. **Absent tutee**: If I mark a learner as absent, I see a "Learner marked as absent" confirmation message
3. **No selection**: If I try to save attendance with no attendance options selected, the action is rejected with a "No attendance option selected." error message
4. **Future attendance**: If a session has not yet occurred, the attendance marking functionality is disabled

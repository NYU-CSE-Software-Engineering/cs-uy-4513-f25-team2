# 🎓 TutorMe – Peer-to-Peer Academic Support Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
**TutorMe** is a Ruby on Rails–powered Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed to centralize peer-to-peer academic support.The system connects students seeking help with approved student tutors, facilitating the coordination of online session scheduling and post-session feedback.

The platform serves three distinct user groups—Learners, Tutors, and Admins—providing a robust user management system with distinct roles, permissions, and a modular architecture.

This project was developed for:
* **Course:** CS-UY 4513 – Software Engineering
* **Professor:** Dr. DePasquale
* **Semester:** Fall 2025

## 🚀 Features

### User & Identity Management
* **Authentication:** Secure registration and login for Learners via email/password.
* **Roles:** Distinct permissions for Learners, Tutors (approved learners), and Admins.
* **Tutor Applications:** Workflow for Learners to apply to become Tutors, with Admin approval/rejection capabilities.

### Scheduling & Session Management
* **Availability:** Tutors publish available time slots (sessions) with specific capacities, subjects, and meeting links.
* **Booking:** Learners search for sessions by Subject and Time Range and "instant-book" slots.
* **Attendance:** Tutors mark Learners as "Present" or "Absent" after meetings to unlock the feedback cycle.
* **Cancellations:** Lifecycle management allowing Learners to cancel bookings and Tutors to cancel entire sessions.

### Tutor & Subject Catalog
* **Browsing:** Learners can search for sessions by specific subjects.
* **Profiles:** Tutors can manage their bios to showcase their qualifications.
* **Subject Management:** Admins can create and archive subjects to keep the catalog relevant.

### Feedback & Reporting
* **Ratings:** Learners submit 1-5 star ratings and comments for sessions they attended.
* **Analytics:** Tutors can view their own feedback history and aggregate ratings.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Ruby 3.4.7
* **Framework:** Ruby on Rails 8.0
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Testing:** RSpec (Unit/Request specs), Cucumber (Behavior-Driven Development), Capybara
